# Unity Obstacle Course

Simple game made within Unity that has the player move past obstacles. This was created within the Unity Engine using C# scripts to control player functionality. This game essentially taught me the basics of game development on Unity.

If you hit an obstacle, it turns blue indicating that you hit that object. If you reach the corresponding orange pad towards the top right you win.
